# Guidelines for File Writing Paths

## Key Considerations

1. **Static Definition of File Writing Paths**  
   File writing paths should not be dynamically determined at runtime using class loaders or similar methods. Instead, these paths should be explicitly defined in a configuration file.

2. **Why Writing to Source is Illogical**  
   Writing to the source directory is logically incorrect because the build process produces artifacts, and the source should remain immutable during runtime.

3. **Why Writing to the Output Directory is Inappropriate**  
   Writing to the output directory may seem viable but is unsuitable for the following reasons:
    - During deployment, any written data will be overwritten when the output artifacts are replaced.
    - This can lead to data loss and unexpected behavior.

## The Correct Approach

- **Write to an External Location**:  
  File writing should target an external location outside the application directories. This ensures the integrity of both source and output directories.

- **Adapt to the Deployment Environment**:  
  The file writing path will vary across different deployment environments. Therefore, it is not feasible to determine the path dynamically or rely on automated methods.

- **Use Configuration Files with Placeholders**:  
  The optimal solution is to define a placeholder for the file writing path in a configuration file. The placeholder can then be replaced with an appropriate value for the deployment environment during setup or deployment.

## Example Configuration

Here is an example of how the file writing path can be specified in a configuration file:

```properties
# Configuration for file writing path
file.write.path=/external/storage/path
